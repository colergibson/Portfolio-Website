						<h5>About Myself</h5>
				
						<p> I am a <span id="age-today">My age</span> year old student who is currently studying at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina.</p>
						
						<p> Early in my life I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to shadow at Wake Forest University and explore the many possible avenues that existed in the library world. Since that opportunity I have volunteered at my public library, the Charles H. Stone Memorial Library in Pilot Mountain and worked at my undergraduate university's library, Smith Library at High Point University.</p>
						
						<p>I am passionate about the pursuit of information and I will work towards creating an environment where any individual will be able to obtain, understand, and use any information that they desire. I have aspirations to work in a library environment with a focus in technical services but I have experience in reference, circulation, and Interlibrary Loan.</p>

						<h5>Education</h5>
						
						<p>I graduated from High Point University with a Bachelor's Degree in English Literature with a minor in History. During my time at High Point, I was selected for induction into Sigma Tau Delta, the International English Honor Society, as well as Phi Alpha Theta, the National History Honor Society. I also received the Presidental Fellowship from High Point University and was named to the Dean's List all four years of my undergraduate education.</p>					
						<p>I am currently pursing a Master's Degree in Library Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with aims to complete my degree in August of 2017. My classes have been a broad stroke of material with focuses ranging from Reference work, Library cataloging, Archive description, Python programming, and many more. For the full listing of my completed courses consult my <a href="experience.html">Experience page</a>.</p>

						<h5>Work Experience</h5>
						
						<p>My first employment was as a student page for Smith Library at High Point University. My job responsibilities consisted of shelving materials and occasional shifts at the Circulation desk where I checked in and out materials.</p>			
						<p>I was promoted from my position as a student page to Interlibrary Loan Assistant. This position was still a student position but I began to work within the Interlibrary Loan department. My job responsibilities were to receive and complete incoming loan requests from both library patrons and outside libraries. This position had me working independently of my supervisor to complete these requests.</p>				
						<p>After my graduation I was offered the position of Centennial Center Supervisor at High Point University. This position was to independently maintain a residential reference desk as well as to work within the main library. My responsibilities for the residential desk included working shifts at the desk, keeping the area supplied with materials, and monitoring maintenance for printers and computer equipment. My responsibilities for the main library were to work shifts at the Circulation and Reference Desk, continue my Interlibrary Loan responsibilities, as well as to open and close the library on occasion.</p>

					<h4>My Interests</h4>

						<h5>My Interests</h5>
						
						<p>When I am not working or taking classes I am a highly trained musician with my main instrument of choice being the Trumpet but I also have 11 years of Piano instruction. I was awarded the John Phillip Sousa Award my senior year of High School. This award is to recognize a single student who displays superior musicianship, dependability, loyalty, and cooperation. For Piano, I recieved a Gold Cup from the North Carolina Federation of Music Clubs for my piano trio work. A gold cup is awarded after a player has obtained 15 points through the rating of performances. I played for High Point University's Pep Band and Symphonic Band rising to lead trumpet. I also helped to form the High Point University Brass Ensemble where I was lead trumpet. Today I still play for hire occasionally with the majority of my work taking place at church services.					
						<p>Beyond music, I am also an avid fan of storytelling in all forms, whether that be through theatre, books, video games, or film. Storytelling has always fascinated me so much that at a young age I pondered becoming a writer. As I aged however, I discovered that I was more interested in the transference of stories rather than the creating them myself. Of particular interest in literature are medeival tales, such as Ivanhoe and the King Arthur tales, Victorian era authors such as Oscar Wilde, Jules Verne, and Robert Louis Stevenson, as well as more modern writers such as Patrick Rothfuss and Ernest Cline.</p>
