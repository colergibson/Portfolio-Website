					<h1>About Myself</h1>
				
					<p> I am a <span id="age-today">My age</span> year old student who is currently studying at the <a href="https://sils.unc.edu/">School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina</a>. I have aspirations to work in a library environment with a focus in technical services but I have experience in reference, circulation, and inter-library loan.</p>

					<p> Early in my life I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to shadow at <a href="http://www.wfu.edu/">Wake Forest University</a> and explore the many possible avenues that existed in the library world. Since that opportunity I have volunteered at my public library, the Charles H. Stone Memorial Library in Pilot Mountain, worked as an undergraduate page at the <a href="http://www.highpoint.edu/library/">Smith Library</a> at <a href="http://www.highpoint.edu/">High Point University</a> and was fortunate to continue working there after my graduation; with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature, as a reference and inter-library loan assistant.</p>

					<p> I began my study at SILS in 2016 and plan to graduate in August of 2017 with a Masters in Library Science. For more information about my classroom experiences such as classes I have completed and projects completed please visit my <a href="experience.html">Experience page</a>.</p>
